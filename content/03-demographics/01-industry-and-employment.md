# Industry & Employment

The unemployment rate of Wayne County has followed historical trends nationwide but has generally remained higher than the average Indiana unemployment rate. During the early 1980s and the early 1990s the recessions that affected the United States were more sharply apparent in Wayne County, when unemployment rates reached peaks of 14.7 percent and 12.5 percent. Indiana averages were affected by these economic recessions to a lesser degree than Wayne County, which can be explained by the high percentage of workers employed in retail trade and manufacturing; these sectors are generally responsive to larger economic conditions and therefore would experience a greater setback from an economic recession. This may show a need to diversify the employment base in Wayne County and in Hagerstown to avoid high unemployment during future economic recessions.

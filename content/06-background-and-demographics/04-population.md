The age figures for a particular area are a good measure of the current population structure of that area and how that area may grow into the future.   Over fifty-five percent of the population is between the ages of 18 and 64, which indicates that Hagerstown has a strong working age population.  An additional twenty-six percent of the townâ€™s population is under 18 and will be of prime working age within the next two decades.  This shows that Hagerstown has a strong workforce both currently and for the near future.  The median age in the town was 37.9 years.

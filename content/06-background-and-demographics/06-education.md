The Nettle Creek School Corporation, which serves the residents of Hagerstown, ranks above state average in many areas, according to data provided by the Indiana Department of Education.  Nettle Creek had a higher attendance rate (97 percent) and a higher graduation rate (90.2 percent) than Indiana averages (96.1, 88.3 respectively) during the 2011-2012 school year. The school corporation also consistently ranks higher on standardized test scores than the state averages. All of the figures begin to give an indication of the high quality of schools available in Hagerstown.
The Indiana Department of Education sets a standard level of achievement for the Indiana Standardized Test of Educational Progress (ISTEP) for each grade level that participates in the testing. The 2011-2012 ISTEP results showed that Nettle Creek students placed above these Indiana academic standards overall. Typically over three-quarters of the students scored above or well above the standards. Nettle Creek students generally scored about 5% higher than the average Indiana student.

# Industry & Employment

The unemployment rate of Wayne County has followed historical trends nationwide but has generally remained higher than the average Indiana unemployment rate.  Indiana averages have been affected by economic recessions to a lesser degree than Wayne County, which can be explained by the high percentage of workers employed in retail trade and manufacturing; these sectors are generally responsive to larger economic conditions and therefore would experience a greater setback from an economic recession. This may show a need to diversify the employment base in Wayne County and in Hagerstown to avoid high unemployment during future economic recessions.

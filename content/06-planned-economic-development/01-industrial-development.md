# Industrial Development

Industrial development considers opportunities for fully utilizing industrial buildings and Hagerstown’s industrial park.  It also considers alternative forms of industry, such as cottage industries and local value-added industries.  The major goals of industrial development in Hagerstown include attracting technology-based small business, encouraging farm-based business and agricultural industries, creating a market for local value-added industries, maintaining environmental sustainability, and encouraging further development of brownfields.

##Goals and Action Plans

-	**Provide adequate infrastructure services to support technology-based business**
  -	Technology-based business would help to diversify the Hagerstown economy and encourage a large number of smaller businesses. In order to encourage technology-based business to locate in Hagerstown, or to encourage technology-based entrepreneurship, appropriate infrastructure must be provided.  This infrastructure includes the availability of ISDN telephone/communication lines and high-speed Internet services.
-	**Focus recruitment efforts on agricultural value-added industries***
  -	Adding value to local agricultural products through processing, packaging, or transportation can benefit Hagerstown’s industrial climate. Creating a local value-added agricultural program in Hagerstown could be possible through the Indiana Value-Added Grant Program, which is designed to increase the value of Indiana-produced agricultural commodities.  Grants are available for agricultural value-added activities, including research and development of new programs or processes.
-	**Recruit industries and small businesses that add value to locally-produced goods and services**
  -	The purpose of local value-added industry is to increase the multiplier effect, or the number of times a dollar circulates through the community. Hagerstown can recruit businesses or encourage entrepreneurs who would add value, through processing, packaging, or transportation, to the goods and services currently being produced in Hagerstown. These industries may add value to agricultural products produced near Hagerstown, or they may add value to the toys, candy, and other goods produced in Hagerstown through packaging or shipping.

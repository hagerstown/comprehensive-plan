# Mandate

Indiana statute, Title 36, Article 7, as amended, empowers towns and cities to plan.  This mandate encourages towns “to improve the health, safety, convenience, and welfare of their citizens and to plan for the future development of their communities” (IC 36-7-4-201).  In exercising planning and zoning, towns should:
- Carefully plan highway systems
- Grow only with adequate public way, utility, health, educational, and recreational facilities
- Recognize the needs of agriculture, forestry, industry, and business in future growth
- Provide residential areas with healthful surroundings for family life
- Ensure that the growth of the community is commensurate with and promotive of the efficient and economical use of public funds

IC 36-7-4-201 also provides for the establishment of “single and unified planning and zoning entities.” 

Town planning commissions are charged with preparing a comprehensive plan (IC 36-7-4-501).  Comprehensive plans must include: 

- A statement of objectives for the future development of the jurisdiction
- A statement of policy for the land use development of the jurisdiction
- A statement of policy for the development of public ways, public places, public lands, public structures, and public utilities

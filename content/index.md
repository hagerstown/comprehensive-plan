# Welcome

Welcome to the Hagerstown, Indiana Comprehensive Plan! 

Hagerstown, Indiana is a town of approximately 2,000 happy people in East Central Indiana.  Located near the intersection of State Road 1 and State Road 38, ours is a vibrant and historic community that boasts a candy factory and a locally-famous smorgasbord, and is the hometown of notables such as Ralph Teetor, the inventor of cruise control, and Clark Wissler, the famed anthropologist.

Compiled by the Hagerstown Planning Commission, the Comprehensive Plan is meant to guide smart growth in our community. It is also a living document; it is continually updated to reflect Hagerstown's immediate and long-term goals for the future.

# Land Use Planning

Land use in Hagerstown is primarily residential.  With the exception of one subdivision, all of the housing is in neighborhood blocks located on either side of Main Street (State Road 38).  Most commercially-zoned land is located along Main Street.  There is also a large amount of land zoned for industrial use in and around Hagerstown.  Land use planning is important in determining the best uses for land available in Hagerstown, and the impacts of certain uses on that land.

## Goals and Action Plans
-	**Revise ordinances that discourage normal agricultural practices***
  - Agricultural zoning needs to be defined to recognize agriculture as legitimate land use, rather than considering agricultural land to be undeveloped. Farmland preservation programs, such as donation or sale of development rights and conservation easements, should be considered to offer incentives for farmland preservation.
-	**Allow for some farm-based businesses**
  - Agricultural zones should also allow for some farm-related businesses.  Farm-related businesses are those involved in the transportation, processing, packaging, and distribution of agricultural products.

# Character

Historic architecture, new buildings, sidewalks, streets, lighting, and landscaping are all a part of the Hagerstown’s character.  Maintaining the appearance of downtown and residential neighborhoods will contribute to the overall aesthetic appeal of the town, projecting a positive image of the high quality of life in Hagerstown.  

##Goals and Action Plans
-	**Encourage new development to be consistent with the Nettle Creek Look**
  - The Nettle Creek Look has been defined by local artist Jim Harting and adopted as the official “look,” or character, of Hagerstown.  Examples of this look should be developed and made available to the interested businesses and residents.  When development plans are approved, developers should be encouraged to integrate the Nettle Creek Look into the design.
-	**Extend streetscape elements throughout town and to the State Road 1 corridor**
  - The streetscape elements that define Hagerstown should be extended to cover both sides of Main Street.  Increasing the community’s frontage by extending these elements will also enhance town character and make the community more inviting to residents and visitors.
-	**Draw residents and tourists into the downtown**
  - By encouraging mixed-use development including housing in the downtown area, more residents and visitors will be drawn to Main Street.  Providing convenient and well-marked parking areas and establishing pedestrian linkages between the downtown, schools, and parks will also increase the flow of people through downtown.
-	**Enhance existing gateways to welcome residents and visitors into Hagerstown**
  - Gateways, such as the signage near State Road 1 and State Road 38, welcome residents and visitors to a community.  Similar gateways should be constructed at other entrances to town.  Creating a design that allows for volunteer labor and donated materials would decrease cost and encourage community participation in the maintenance of gateways.
-	**Provide incentive to businesses that contribute to community character and involve people of all ages in improving Hagerstown character** 
  - Many projects which would improve community character could be done by volunteer groups and local organizations.  Volunteers of all ages, especially children and teens, should be encouraged to participate in activities such as the construction and maintenance of community gateways.

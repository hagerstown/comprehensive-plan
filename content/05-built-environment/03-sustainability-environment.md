# Environmental Sustainability

Sustainability refers to the managing of environmental, economic, and social development in ways that balance resources
and needs, nature and humanity. Environmental sustainability satisfies basic human needs (clean air and water) and 
conserves the natural, cultural, and historical environment while providing for managed growth and development, also known 
as **Smart Growth**. 

Smart Growth adds homes and jobs to a community while protecting and preserving environmental resources. Principles of Smart 
Growth include: 

- Allowing for **mixed land use** within the community
- Making use of **compact building design** as opposed to large, sprawling development patterns
- Creating **walkable neighborhoods**
- Preserving **open space and natural beauty** in our community
- Encouraging construction and development in **existing communities**
- Ensuring that Smart Growth is **cost effective and within reach** of developers

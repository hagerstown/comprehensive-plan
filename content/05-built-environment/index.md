There is also a large amount of land zoned for industrial use in and around Hagerstown.  Land use planning is important in determining the best uses for land available in Hagerstown, and the impacts of certain uses on that land.
- **Growth Management** - Even as Hagerstown continues to grow and encourage the development of business in and around the community, it is important to manage this growth in such a way that Hagerstown maintains its small town character and quality of life.  Growth management prevents development that is disconnected from the rest of the community, which would put an additional burden on infrastructure and on area farmers.

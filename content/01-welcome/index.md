Welcome to Hagerstown's Comprehensive Plan. This plan is divided into several sections and subsections as described below.

The first three are **quality of life**, **built environment**, and **planned economic development**. Within these topics you can find goals and action plans outlining Hagerstown's plan for moving into the future.

In the section titled **Background and Demographics** you will find information on the Indiana state **mandate** which empowers towns to plan; a brief **history** of the town of Hagerstown; information about **town government**; **community input** regarding the town's future, collected from public meetings and surveys; as well as **demographics** where you can find data on Hagerstown's residential and commercial makeup.

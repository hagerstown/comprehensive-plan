# Built Environment

In Hagerstown, the **built environment** interacts with the natural environment to create a beautiful, functional community for those who live here.  By managing the town’s **character**, **infrastructure**, **environmental sustainability**, **land use planning**, and **growth management**, Hagerstown can ensure smart growth. This will allow for development while maintaining and protecting the town’s historical, cultural, and natural resources.

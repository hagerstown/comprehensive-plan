# Schools

The Nettle Creek School Corporation, consisting of Hagerstown Elementary and Hagerstown Jr./Sr. High School, services Hagerstown and the surrounding area.  Hagerstown’s schools are an integral part of the community, and their continued success is vital to the town’s growth.  By working together, town government officials and school board members can ensure that the Nettle Creek Schools continue to produce high-achieving, successful, motivated students.

##Goals and Action Plans
-	**Review the need for a middle school separate from the high school**
  - Some residents have expressed concern that junior high students would be more likely to excel if they were placed in a separate middle school.  Many middle school students, after moving on from elementary, are not yet prepared for the social environment of high school.  A separate facility would allow for a more appropriate educational and social environment for middle school-aged children.
-	**Work with the school board and faculty to modernize the curriculum**
  - Hagerstown students must be prepared to either continue their education after high school or enter the workforce with skills valued by employers.  Further implementation of Advanced Placement courses can allow students to gain college credit while attending high school.  Integrating computers into the classroom, forming partnerships with businesses, and placing a greater emphasis on communication skills will also provide Hagerstown students with the skills needed to excel in today’s workforce.

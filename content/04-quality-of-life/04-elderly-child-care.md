# Elderly/Child Care

Hagerstown has a growing need for elderly care and child care services.  While some child care services are available in Hagerstown, more licensed facilities are needed.  The elderly also require more services, such as home visits by trained professionals and increased housing options.  (For more on elderly housing goals, see the Housing subsection.)

##Goals and Action Plans
-	**Revise ordinances to allow home-based businesses, subject to standards**
  - Childcare is frequently provided by individuals in their own homes.  Local ordinances should be reviewed to ensure that they do not prohibit this activity, and that they provide proper requirements for daycares to meet state standards.
-	**Organize a sick child care program**
  - A sick child care program could be a cooperative effort between local businesses, who stand to benefit through increased productivity of parent/workers, and volunteers, who can help provide sick child care. 
-	**Organize a home healthcare program**
  - Home healthcare programs are frequently available, but costs can at times be prohibitive.  The services currently available in and around Hagerstown should be reviewed, and nearby providers informed of the community’s needs.  Incentives and/or subsidies could be provided to those willing to donate services and ensure Hagerstown’s residents receive the appropriate care.
-	**Encourage development of a progressive care living community**
  - In keeping with the goals outlined in the Housing subsection, Hagerstown should encourage the development of a multi-stage assisted living facility for elders with a range of care needs.  The Chamber of Commerce should promote Hagerstown as an optimum location for such a facility, and the Town should ensure it is properly located.
-	**Develop an adopt-a-grandparent program**
  - Young people and the elderly can benefit from one another’s company and experiences through an adopt-a-grandparent program.  In programs of this type, youths and elders are matched based on common experiences or interests.  The pair then spends time reading and visiting together.  Such a program could be coordinated through a local service organization.

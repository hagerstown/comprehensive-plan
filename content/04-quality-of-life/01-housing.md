# Housing

Much of the housing in Hagerstown consists of single-family homes rich in character.  As such, future housing goals center on property maintenance as well as diversifying the types of available housing to accommodate a changing population.  

##Goals and Action Plans
-	**Encourage affordable housing for all**
  -	Allowing higher net densities of six to seven units per acre would increase the amount of affordable housing options.  Ordinances can be put in place to allow for these higher densities while simultaneously avoiding the appearance of crowding through design.
  -	Encourage cost-effective site development and construction methods through incentive programs and marketing to developers. 
  -	Encouraging the implementation of energy-saving features in existing and new housing can also lower the cost of home maintenance for residents.
-	**Encourage the development of assisted living housing for the elderly**
  -	Housing intended for the elderly, including assisted living care, should be centrally located with easy access to goods and services.  Progressive care facilities are often designed as small communities, and can include doctor’s offices, pharmacies, administrative offices, hospice care, apartments or town houses, and single-family residential units.  Hagerstown can be marketed to developers as an ideal location for these types of facilities, and town ordinances can allow for this type of multiple use development.
-	**Focus housing development and redevelopment efforts in accordance with the land use plan**
  -	The land use and growth management section of the comprehensive plan encourages appropriate and efficient land development in Hagerstown. When residential development plans are approved, they should comply with those recommendations. 
  -	Revise the zoning ordinance and map as necessary to implement the recommendations of the land use and growth management section.
  -	Encourage developers to renovate or build housing in zoning districts where permitted and as recommended in the land use and growth management section.
-	**Increase citizen awareness of home maintenance programs and grants**
  -	Make residents aware of the town’s 50/50 sidewalk maintenance program.
  -	Develop a strategic plan for maintaining sidewalks, accessibility ramps, and curbs throughout Hagerstown’s neighborhoods.  This can include the creation of a maintenance schedule. Improvements can be funded by a combination of municipal funds, such as EDIT tax revenues, and property owner usage fees.
-	**Investigate state programs for housing development and redevelopment, and research federal housing programs**
  -	Housing development and redevelopment programs exist at both the state and federal government levels.  These programs are designed to assist communities in providing affordable housing for low- and moderate-income residents or for specific segments of the population, such as the elderly. Program requirements and deadlines change frequently, so one member of town government should be responsible for researching, monitoring, and making recommendation about these programs to the Town Council.

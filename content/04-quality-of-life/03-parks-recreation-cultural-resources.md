# Parks, Recreation, & Cultural Resources

Hagerstown provides its residents with excellent access to parks and recreation facilities.  Goals regarding parks, recreation, and other cultural resources such as the museum and library seek to make these facilities accessible to a larger number of residents, to increase the use of present park-goers, and to provide even more opportunities for cultural activities in and around Hagerstown.

##Goals and Action Plans
-	**Create opportunities for pedestrians to move safely between parks**
  - Creating a linear park system in which residents could safely walk from park to park would increase park usage.  Existing and proposed open spaces, schools, public buildings, and other points of interest need to be mapped in order to determine a pedestrian passage system between these areas.  Acquisition of land and/or easements may be necessary in some areas to complete a linear park system, while existing paths, sidewalks, and open public spaces would compose most of the pedestrian pathway.  Such a pathway should be well-lit during park hours and have adequate signage at intersections.
-	**Create parks that provide new types of recreational opportunity**
  - Parks and recreation areas can fulfill a number of needs.  Some parks are for active recreation such as group sports, individual sports, and playground activities, while others are designed for passive recreation such as walking or jogging.  Still other parks are designed to preserve natural areas and wildlife habitat or to prevent development in flood-prone areas.  As Hagerstown creates new open spaces and recreation areas, emphasis should be given to developing the new parks for uses that are underserved in the existing parks.
-	**Identify opportunities and needs for improving park spaces and update equipment and other amenities***
  - Some of the existing park spaces are in need of updated equipment or facilities.  An inventory of equipment and facilities should be made for each park.  After assessing their condition, recommendations can be made for improvement.  The inventory should include parking, lighting, signage, playground equipment, and sport field equipment.
  - After an inventory has been conducted, the items identified for upgrade should be scheduled for maintenance or replacement.  Funding will need to be obtained for these upgrades.  Much of this funding should be budgeted into the town’s finances over a period of several years, with improvements made as funding becomes available.  There may also be grant money available for the maintenance of community spaces; grant money could then be leveraged with funds from the J. Miller endowment. 
-	**Find creative ways to maintain the Dutro Community Pool**
  - Action plan
-	**Organize recreational activities for people of all ages and abilities**
  - Recreation activities in the parks need to be organized for people of all ages and ability levels.  Youth activities are well-coordinated by the school district; as such, youth activities outside of the school are generally only needed during the summer months.  Activities should be scheduled for stay-at-home parents and the active elderly throughout the year.
-	**Develop an Adopt-a-Park program**
  - Various groups within the community could display their community pride and commitment to improving Hagerstown through an Adopt-a-Park program.  The program would divide the town’s parks, open spaces, and recreation areas into manageable sections, and adopting groups would then be responsible for each section’s cleanup and maintenance.
-	**Develop a community center with activities for a variety of age groups**
  - Hagerstown residents take pride in the town’s excellent senior citizen center while recognizing a need for indoor recreation for other age groups.  After determining the types of activities desired by various age groups, these activities could be accommodated within the Meeting Place or another community center in town.  Staffing could be provided by volunteers or staff paid by the Park Board.  Funding could come from donations, sponsorships, grants, or leveraged with the J. Miller endowment. 
-	**Develop cultural recreation opportunities**
  -	Active outdoor recreation is provided by Hagerstown’s parks, but cultural recreation ought also to be encouraged.  Music performances could be coordinated in the downtown park across from Town Hall; this would draw visitors to Willie and Red’s as well as local residents.  The Hagerstown Museum and Arts Place, Dance With Cindy, the library, and other cultural resources can also be encouraged to provide entertainment and cultural activities for the town.

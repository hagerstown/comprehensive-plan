The Nettle Creek School Corporation, consisting of Hagerstown Elementary and Hagerstown Jr./Sr. High School, services Hagerstown and the surrounding area. Hagerstown’s schools are an integral part of the community, and their continued success is vital to the town’s growth. By working together, town government officials and school board members can ensure that the Nettle Creek Schools continue to produce high-achieving, successful, motivated students.

##Goals and Action Plans

-	**Develop a method to build a profile from empirical data and individual feedback gathered from former students to determine what has been educationally effective, what has not and how it has enhanced or hindered their success.**

-	**Work with the school board, superintendent and faculty to fulfill the Nettle Creek School Corporation’s visions and goals.** 

-	**Encourage the development of a mentor program in both the elementary and junior/senior high school.**

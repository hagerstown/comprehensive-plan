The Nettle Creek School Corporation, consisting of Hagerstown Elementary and Hagerstown Jr./Sr. High School, services Hagerstown and the surrounding area.  Hagerstown’s schools are an integral part of the community, and their continued success is vital to the town’s growth.  By working together, town government officials and school board members can ensure that the Nettle Creek Schools continue to produce high-achieving, successful, motivated students.

##Goals and Action Plans

-	**Work with the school board, superintendent, and faculty to revise/improve the curriculum**
  - Hagerstown students must be prepared to either continue their education after high school or enter the workforce with skills valued by employers.  Further implementation of Advanced Placement courses can allow students to gain college credit while attending high school.  Integrating computers into the classroom, forming partnerships with businesses, and placing a greater emphasis on communication skills will also provide Hagerstown students with the skills needed to excel in today’s workforce.

-	**Graduate profile / survey, etc**

-	**Work with the school to accomplish the goals set by the school board, etc.** 

-	**Mentoring**

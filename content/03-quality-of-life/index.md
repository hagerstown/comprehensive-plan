# Quality of Life

What does **quality of life** mean for Hagerstown?  In a public meeting held on June 12, 2013, Hagerstown residents were asked just that.  The answer: quality of life means that all have access to education, safety, recreation, and a clean and beautiful place to live.  Thus, in order to uphold the quality of life for all residents, the Comprehensive Plan sets out goals relating to **Housing**; **Community Involvement**; **Parks**, **Recreation**, & **Cultural Resources**; **Elder/Child Care**; and **Schools**.

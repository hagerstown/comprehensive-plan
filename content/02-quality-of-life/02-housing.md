# Housing

There are 865 housing units in Hagerstown. Ninety-three percent are occupied and seven percent are vacant, the same percentages as for Wayne County as a whole and about the same as for the state of Indiana as a whole. Of those Hagerstown housing units which are occupied, 69 percent are occupied by owners and 31 percent by renters. These percentages also are very similar to those for the county and state.

Examining the age of householders, the percentages of occupied housing units with householders in each age group are generally about the same for Hagerstown as for Wayne County and Indiana. The exception is in the age group of householders 75 and over, where Hagerstown has more householders by far than the county or state. This is true for both owners and renters. It suggests that even at age 75 or older, Hagerstown residents are able to be the head of their household, but also that there are no real alternatives. However, the high number of these older householders supports other observations about the possible need for home maintenance programs for this group, or for alternative forms of housing that require lower maintenance. These needs were frequently mentioned in interviews with community residents.

The percentage of households by number of units per structure shows the composition of the communityâ€™s housing stock. In Hagerstown, as in the county and state as a whole, the vast majority of housing is single family detached housing units. Slightly more of the housing in Hagerstown than in the county or state is of this type. Hagerstown has more two-family homes, or doubles (also called duplexes), than the county or state, but less mobile homes or trailers than the county and state. Hagerstown also has slightly more small multi-family buildings (three to nine dwelling units), but fewer large multi- family buildings (ten or more dwelling units).

More of Hagerstown single family detached housing units are owned and less are rented than in the county or state as a whole, but more of Hagerstown two- family housing units are rented. This may suggest that doubles are an acceptable form of rental housing in Hagerstown.

Housing units in Hagerstown are generally older than in the county or state as a whole. Hagerstown has more housing units built before 1959, and less built after 1959. This suggests housing may be in need of repair or upgrading, a fact reinforced by site visits and interviews with community residents.

The median value of all owner-occupied housing in Hagerstown in 1990, the latest year for which data are available, was $44,500, which was higher than the Wayne County median housing value of 42,220 dollars, but lower than the Indiana median housing value of $53,500. This is the same pattern as median household income, which is typical. The distribution of housing units in different value categories shows that the majority of housing in Hagerstown was valued in the $25,000 to $74,99 range.

Community residents were concerned that new housing going in is more expensive, and that there is a lack of housing available in all price ranges.

# Community Input

Community input is a vital component of the Comprehensive Plan, as it provides valuable insight into the strengths, 
goals, wants and needs of the Hagerstown community.  

The Hagerstown Plan Commission has collected community input through both surveys and public meetings.  The results 
of this input provide direction for future goals and action plans.

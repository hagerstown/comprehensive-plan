# Community Input

Community input is a vital component of the Comprehensive Plan, as it provides valuable insight into the strengths, 
goals, wants and needs of the Hagerstown community.  

The Hagerstown Plan Commission has collected community input through both surveys and public meetings.  The results 
of this input provide direction for future goals and action plans.

##Survey Responses

Surveys were distributed to Hagerstown residents via email, social media, postal mail, and various town locations 
such as the IGA grocery store, Nettle Creek Hardware store, and the Hagerstown-Jefferson Township Library.  

**Survey Questions**

- Resident’s gender
- Resident’s age
- Resident’s employment status
- Resident’s relationship status
- Whether resident’s household includes children under 18

Results of the survey were compiled and assessed by members of the Plan Commission.

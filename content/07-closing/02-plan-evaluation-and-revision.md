# Plan Evaluation and Revision

Planning is never finished. As our community changes and develops, so too must the Comprehensive Plan. In order to ease 
the revision process, the Hagerstown Comprehensive Plan has been designed and developed as a **living document** which 
resides on the Internet. This format allows for frequent editing by the Hagerstown Plan Commission. 

It is recommended that the Hagerstown Plan Commission review the contents of the Comprehensive Plan every six months. Upon 
review, members may add relevant new goals and action plans. They may also strike completed goals. Completed goals should 
be marked as such, and may be left on the website for up to two years. This will allow the Plan Commission, as well as 
members of the community, to review past successes and Hagerstown's current trajectory.

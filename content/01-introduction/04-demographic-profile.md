# Demographic Profile

## Population

<aside>Whenever possible current data has been used. However, certain statistics are only reliable from the Census Bureau. The last Census was conducted in 2010.</aside>

The official population of Hagerstown according to the 1990 Census is 1,835 persons. This six percent decline from 1980 was part of a declining population trend from 1970 to the most recent population estimate (1996). The estimated 1996 population was 1,772. The county population follows a similar declining trend, whereas the state population continues to rise.

The age figures for a particular area are a good measure of the current population structure of that area and how that area may grow in the future. Hagerstown has a high concentration of people between the ages of 45 and 54 and a high number of females between the ages of 70 and 79. Almost 60 percent of the population is between the ages of 18 and 64, which indicates that Hagerstown has a strong working age population. An additional 22 percent of the town’s population is under the age of 18 and will be of prime working age within the next two decades. This shows that Hagerstown has a strong workforce both currently and for the near future.

As the traditional economic base changes there will be an increasing tendency towards young families looking for a quaint bedroom community with good schools and for more senior citizens that prefer not to move.

## Households

According to the 1990 Census, Hagerstown contains 807 households, most of which are single families occupied houses they owned. Children, householders and their spouses make up the largest percentage of persons in the town, accounting for 81 percent of the total population. However, for persons 65 and older (about 20 percent of the town population) the household type is much different. Over half of the members of the aged community were either householders or their spouses, but a significant number (41 percent) were non-family householders living alone. There are no elderly persons living in group quarters, such as nursing homes, since Hagerstown has none of these facilities. These statistics are typical with those of Indiana in general.

## Families and Family Type

Hagerstown contains 542 families of which 84 percent are married couples. About 72.5 percent of these married couple families have no children of their own under age 18. This and the community age distribution suggests that there are a large number of empty-nesters in the community. Female householders with no male present account for over 12 percent of all families in Hagerstown, making it the next largest group after married couple families.

## Birthplace and Migration

The majority of Hagerstown residents are native born Hoosiers. Over 80 percent of the residents were born in the state of Indiana, with the majority of people that were born out-of-state from either the southern U.S. or other parts of the midwest.

Slightly over half of the residents lived in the same house in 1985. Nearly 60 percent of the people who did not live in the same house in 1985 did live in Wayne County.

## Income and Poverty

Median household income helps to show the prosperity of community residents, especially when compared to the median household income of other communities. In Hagerstown the median household income in 1989, the latest year for which data are available, was 25,428 dollars. This was greater than the median household income in Wayne County as a whole, which was 23,475 dollars, but less than the median household income for Indiana as a whole, which was 28,797 dollars. This pattern is quite common for small towns such as Hagerstown, where living expenses also are moderate.

The distribution of household incomes shows how many households in the community earned incomes in particular income categories. The highest ranking category in Hagerstown in 1989, the latest year for which data are available, was the 15,000 to 19,999 dollar category. Over 100 of the total 804 households in Hagerstown earned incomes in that category. The majority of households in Hagerstown earned incomes ranging from less than 5,000 dollars up to 74,999 dollars. The categories within that range were well- distributed. Only a few households in Hagerstown earned 75,000 dollars or more, though a few did range up to the 150,000 or more category. All of this suggests that Hagerstown is a relatively stable middle class community, with no significant income disparity.

Hagerstown is generally a prosperous community. Only nine percent of its total population earned incomes below the poverty level in 1989, the latest year for which data are available, compared to 14 percent of Wayne County’s population and ten percent of Indiana’s population. The median income may have decreased during the 1990s due to the closure of the Dana plant.

<div class="ph ph-chart">Percentage of Persons Below Poverty Level by Age</div>

Examining those persons below the poverty level by age group, however shows more about what kinds of people in each community are below the poverty level. In Hagerstown, the most prosperous residents are children aged five to 11, adults aged 35 to 44, and older adults aged 55 to 74. This makes some sense because the adults aged 35 to 44 are in their prime working years and they are probably the parents of the children aged five to 11. Some of the least prosperous residents in Hagerstown are children under five, young adults aged 18 to 34, and older adults aged 75 and over. The percentage of young adults aged 18 to 34 below the poverty level is especially troubling, and may suggest a shortage of sufficient employment opportunities in the area. These age groups are probably the parents of the children under five who are below the poverty level.

The percentage of persons aged 75 and over with income below the poverty level is much higher in Hagerstown than in Wayne County or Indiana as a whole. Looking at this age group more closely shows that of Hagerstown householders aged 74 and over with incomes below the poverty level, none are in married-couple families, a small percentage are female householders living alone, and the vast majority are householders living alone. Because of their income, age, and household type, this group may have special needs for programs such as health care and home maintenance.

## Industry

In both Wayne County and Hagerstown, manufacturing was the largest sector of employment, followed by professional and related services as the second largest sector, and retail trade as the third largest sector. These three leading sectors account for approximately three-quarters of the employment in Hagerstown and Wayne County. The remaining employment sectors were evenly distributed, with three to four percent of the workforce holding jobs in these industries.

<aside>Most business data is only available for the county, not for individual cities and towns. Therefore, location quotient, shift-share analysis, and employment data have been completed at the county level. Comparisons to Hagerstown are made based on anecdotal and observational data.</aside>

<div class="ph ph-chart">Occupation by Worker in Hagerstown</div>

The only notable differences between Hagerstown and Indiana industry averages are in the sectors of construction and public administration; the construction sector in Hagerstown accounts for only half of the amount of the state’s average but the public administration sector accounts for five percent of Hagerstown’s employment as compared to only three percent in both the state and the county.

## Location Quotient

Location quotient analysis is used to ascertain the export capacity of the local economy and give an indication of the degree of self-sufficiency that each individual industry possesses. Here location quotient analysis was computed for selected SIC (Standard Industrial Codes) industries in Wayne County using County Business Pattern data obtained from the Census Bureau. A location quotient that is below 1.0000 is considered a non-basic industry meaning that it normally would not export outside of the community. These industries normally function as support for industries that are exporters and are dependent upon these industries either to provide capital or to provide a consumer base for their secondary products. Those industries with a location quotient number of 1.000 of greater are considered basic industries in the fact that they normally export out of the community. In doing so they act to bring revenue into the community and provide jobs which then support the secondary non-basic businesses. The location quotient should not substitute for local knowledge of industry, however since the location quotient sometimes does not correctly state the export amount in some industries.

In analyzing the location quotients of 1994 employment figures compared to 1984 employment figures, there have been shifts in export capability within the manufacturing and services sectors of the Wayne County economy. The shift in manufacturing from a location quotient value of 1.1080 in 1984 to 0.8722 in 1994 is due to the loss of just under 2,000 jobs in Wayne County and a gain of over 40,000 jobs in the Indiana economy. Although manufacturing almost undoubtedly exports its products outside of the county, the location quotient means that Wayne County has less manufacturing jobs per capita than the state. Much of this shift occurred in the industrial machinery and equipment industry classification (SIC 35) as jobs decreased from 2,037 in 1984 with a location quotient of 2.3406 to 695 jobs in 1994 with a location quotient of 0.9476.

<div class="ph ph-chart">Location Quotient for Wayne County</div>

The services sector of Wayne County’s economy has seen a major increase in employment since 1984 with an increase of just over 5,000 jobs. This has increased the location quotient from 0.9538 in 1984 to 1.2291 in 1994 indicating some industries within the service sector are either exporting or creating more employment opportunities per capita than elsewhere in Indiana. When looking at major industrial classifications within the services sector there has been a large increase within business services (SIC 73) with employment rising from 361 in 1984 with a location quotient of 0.5350 to 3,000 in 1994 with a location quotient of 2.3031.

The location quotient figures for Wayne County for 1990 show that there are several sectors which are considered basic industries. Several of the service sectors, including professional, health, and business services have location quotients greater than one, indicating that these sectors are exported from the community. Public administration, manufacturing of durable goods, and retail trade are also basic sectors in the Wayne County economy. These location quotient figures show that Wayne County has a strong economy, with several sectors exporting outside the community. However, as mentioned previously, the location quotient should not be relied upon as the only indicator of the economy. In comparing these figures to Wayne County, it is important to note that only a small percentage of Wayne County employees work in Hagerstown. However, based on observations made on field visits and interviews with local residents, the same trends seem to apply.

## Shift-Share

To augment location quotient data one must also consider shift share analysis. This is a useful tool for analyzing the change in the structure of the local economy in reference to the State of Indiana as a whole. This takes into account job performance or productivity of each industry and gives information on the proportional shift (which is the rate of growth of the individual sector in the state) and the differential shift (which is used to ascertain the competitive advantage of local industry). By measuring the rate of growth of the local industries and comparing it to growth rates statewide, a positive differential shift would indicate that the local industry is growing faster than similar industries statewide.

In analyzing Wayne County’s shift share, it is interesting to note that there has been a large reduction in the county’s competitive advantage in the manufacturing sector with employment falling from 9,074 in 1984 to 7,087 in 1994 and the differential shift being -0.2909 and the proportional shift being -0.2479. This means that manufacturing in the Indiana economy has contracted although Wayne County’s manufacturing sector’s competitive advantage is much below that of the state on average. Wayne County has enjoyed growth in the services sector with an increase of just over 5,000 jobs and a differential shift of 0.3306 meaning this is a relatively competitive sector for Wayne County.

In examining major industrial classifications, Wayne County has major competitive advantages in trucking and warehousing (SIC 42), where employment has increased from 154 in 1984 to 812 in 1994 with a differential shift of 3.5780, and business services (SIC 73), where employment has increased from 361 in 1984 to 3,000 in 1994 with a differential shift of 6.2247. These high differential shifts indicate an extreme competitive advantage for Wayne County in these industries. As with Location Quotient, it is important to note that only a small percentage of Wayne County employees work in Hagerstown. Based on observational and anecdotal evidence, Hagerstown seems to have mirrored the country’s loss in manufacturing. Hagerstown appears to enjoy a competitive advantage in retail.

## Employment and Unemployment

The unemployment rate of Wayne County has followed historical trends nationwide but has generally remained higher than the average Indiana unemployment rate. During the early 1980s and the early 1990s the recessions that affected the United States were more sharply apparent in Wayne County, when unemployment rates reached peaks of 14.7 percent and 12.5 percent. Indiana averages were affected by these economic recessions to a lesser degree than Wayne County, which can be explained by the high percentage of workers employed in retail trade and manufacturing; these sectors are generally responsive to larger economic conditions and therefore would experience a greater setback from an economic recession. This may show a need to diversify the employment base in Wayne County and in Hagerstown to avoid high unemployment during future economic recessions.

# Area & Context

Hagerstown is situated in Jefferson Township in western Wayne County.  Located approximately thirteen miles west of Richmond and ten miles east of New Castle, the community sits near the intersection of State Road 38 and State Road 1.  Hagerstown is approximately five miles north of Interstate 70, and the town has rail access via the Norfolk and Southern railroad.  The Hagerstown Airport also services the community and can accommodate small aircraft.  

The Cardinal Greenway section of the American Discovery Trail, a rails-to-trails program intended to eventually stretch from Maryland to the Pacific Ocean, passes through Wayne County a few miles north of Hagerstown.

Both Whitewater River and Nettle Creek run through the community, with Nettle Creek feeding into Scout Lake just south of town. In the nineteenth century, Hagerstown was the northern terminus of the White Water Canal, a major canal system which spanned seventy-six miles and was completed in 1847.  Today, many elements of Hagerstown life have taken on the name of Nettle Creek, including the Nettle Creek School Corporation and the Nettle Creek Gazette.

      <h1>Land Use</h1>
      <p>An inventory of the current land uses in Hagerstown is useful in making future land use decisions and changes to development ordinances. Land uses are typically divided in to several categories: residential, commercial and business, industrial, public and quasi-public, farmland, and undeveloped land.</p>

<h2 id='residential'>Residential</h2>

<p>Residential uses currently occupy the most land area in Hagerstown. The majority of the housing is single family detached units, developed in to neighborhood blocks. A limited number of higher density residences are available.</p>

<h2 id='commercial_and_business'>Commercial and Business</h2>

<p>Downtown Hagerstown and the SR 38 corridor are devoted to primarily government and commercial uses. Commercial and business uses occupy only a small percentage of land in Hagerstown, and are focused in the downtown area, but there are some segments of sprawl east towards SR1. This has a negative image for the community, causes congestion, and is more expensive to service. Part of Hagerstown’s charm and character comes from its pedestrian friendly downtown.</p>

<h2 id='industrial'>Industrial</h2>

<p>Industrial land occupies the most land area in Hagerstown following residential uses. There are three industrial parks, an unusually high number for a small town. Small towns should be aware that industrial land should be provided only to the extent that infrastructure support and access is available. Several communities in Indiana have excessive land zoned for industrial uses for which adequate infrastructure support is not available. Currently the industrial areas are under utilized.</p>

<h2 id='public_and_quasipublic'>Public and Quasi-public</h2>

<p>Public land uses in Hagerstown include the schools, library, municipal buildings, cemetery, water treatment plant, post office, and the parks. Quasi- public uses are those which are held by a corporation or organization for the provision of public services. In Hagerstown these include the utility companies and churches, as well as the Optimist Club athletic park.</p>

<h2 id='farmland'>Farmland</h2>

<p>Agricultural land uses are important to Hagerstown and Jefferson Township. Prime farmland should be treated as a legitimate land use, rather than undeveloped land, to protect agricultural resources from development pressure. Much of the land in Jefferson Township (within the Hagerstown zoning fringe) is appropriately used for agriculture.</p>

<h2 id='undeveloped'>Undeveloped</h2>

<p>This is land that for whatever reason has no current use. Some of the land is too poorly drained for development or has topographical limitations, and some is non-prime farmland that may be suitable for development. Some of the undeveloped land in Hagerstown is zoned for uses which are not currently in demand. Much of the undeveloped land is suitable for development at some time in the future.</p>

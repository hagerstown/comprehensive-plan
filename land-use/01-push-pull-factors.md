There are factors within communities that can act to repel, attract, or both. Pull factors are advantages on which the community can build the future. Push factors are those that must be overcome in order to meet the community’s goals. Communities have the ability to exploit the pull factors and minimize the push factors once they have been identified and the community makes a commitment to reaching its goals.

## Pull Factors

The strong advantages on which Hagerstown can build a firm planning base are its pull factors. These factors include:

- Interstate development at the I-70 interchange – Although plans have been progressing slower than anticipated, development at the interstate interchanges could provide for a more sound tourism industry. There may be other benefits as well. However, this type of development frequently encourages sprawling development from communities out to the interchange development. It is also infrastructure intensive.
- Community character – Hagerstown has a truly unique and interesting small town character. It is attractive to residents and visitors alike. A number of downtown and community improvements could enhance this character so that the town’s full tourism potential can be recognized.
- Tourism – A tourism base already exists in Hagerstown with thousands of visitors each year coming to eat at Welliver’s and enjoy shopping at Abbott’s Candy and the local antique and craft shops. If combined into tour packages including visiting Amish farms, traditional homesteads, local museums, and other attractions of the county the tourism industry could provide a strong economic base for Hagerstown.
- Access to other cities – The convenient access to Richmond, New Castle, Muncie, Indianapolis, Dayton and other cities makes Hagerstown an ideal location for people to want to live. It also makes a good transhipment point for warehousing and other industries. There are problems associated with this level of access as well; these are discussed as push factors.
- Good community parks – Hagerstown has excellent community park facilities. These facilities are used and enjoyed primarily by community residents. Expanding the parks into a parks system and developing additional recreation opportunities will enhance the quality of life in Hagerstown.
- Amish population – while the Amish are new to the Hagerstown area, there already appears to be a growing relationship between the Amish and non-Amish communities. There is potential for tourism development, locally produced goods, and other activities involving the emerging Amish community.
- Little/no town debt – the town has been fortunate enough to avoid an accumulation of debt. This leaves the town in a stable financial position from which it can make decisions about the financing of new projects.

## Push Factors

The challenges that detract from Hagerstown’s vitality are the pull factors. They can be mitigated to enhance the quality of life in the community. These factors include:

- Lack of strong industrial base – Dana Corporation leaving Hagerstown left the town without a strong industrial base. This has caused a number of residents to find employment in the surrounding communities. There is potential for development of a new industrial base of small businesses, local value added industries, and others that don’t have some of the problems of a single, large, auto industry employment base.
- Lack of available housing/age and maintenance of existing housing stock – There is not a lot of housing available for new residents and the housing stock is of the same relative size and style. The lack of housing and housing variety discourages new residents and new business. Much of the housing in the community is aging, and some is in need of maintenance or renovation. This is a deterrent to tourism, new residents, and new business and industry.
- Access to other cities – The close proximity of other communities is encouraging Hagerstown to become a bedroom community. This type of community lacks the tax base and other resources to provide for many of the community services that Hagerstown residents value. It also leads to traffic problems and sprawling development between the bedroom community and the employment base. Redeveloping a local economic base would allow more residents to work in the community and provide the tax base necessary to support a high level of community services.
- The Dana building/environmental problems – the Dana site is on a lengthy environmental clean up schedule due to the lack of regard for resources that was associated with previous decades and the rust belt industries. The site has potential for reuse if the environmental problems can be mitigated in a more timely fashion than the current schedule provides. New industrial sites should meet certain criteria or performance standards to reduce the potential for future environmental problems.
- Hagerstown’s aging population – While the older members of the community have been valuable lifelong assets to the community, there are problems associated with an aging population. Older residents are no longer contributing to the community’s economic base, in terms of employment and earned income taxes. Older residents also have a need for age appropriate housing and special help with home maintenance. There are also health care issues associated with older residents. Many are in need of more professional health care than is available in Hagerstown.
- Leapfrog and sprawling development – The development of subdivisions, housing lots, commercial and industrial developments that are not adjacent to other development in the community is land consumptive and burdens local infrastructure. The extra capacity spent on sprawling new development could be used for the upgrade of existing services to better serve development that is adjacent to other development. Also, since most newer residents work elsewhere, this begins to make Hagerstown more of a bedroom community, increasing traffic congestion, and reducing community character.

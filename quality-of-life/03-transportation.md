Eighty percent of the workers in Hagerstown held jobs in Wayne County; an additional 18 percent of the workforce held jobs inside Indiana but outside of Wayne County. Only one percent of Hagerstownâ€™s workforce worked outside of the state. More Hagerstown workers were employed in Wayne County than the Indiana averages for workers remaining in their county of residence. When a large percentage of the workforce remains inside its county of residence for employment, travel times to work are reduced. Travel times may have increased during the 1990s as more Hagerstown residents needed to find employment outside of town.

Of the Hagerstown residents working within Wayne County, 54 percent remained in the town to work and the other 46 percent worked elsewhere in the county. The high percentage of workers employed in town shows that Hagerstown has a fairly healthy employment base; this figure shows that most workers can find jobs they need in town instead of looking elsewhere. As noted above, colloquial evidence suggests that more Hagerstown residents may work out of town now than in 1989.

As more new homes are built these will tend to be occupied by commuters which will change the character of the community as well as increasing traffic patterns.
